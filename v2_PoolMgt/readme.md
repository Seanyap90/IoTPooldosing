<h1>Pool Management Software</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Despite a good start where the company I found secured early contracts from 3 customers for using DosAuto, we are unable to get meaningful traction.  Hence it was back to the drawing board on how to get the business going again. 
 Unfortunately, there was a huge disagreement among the cofounders on the strategic direction, so we decided to stick on what may seem to work according to gut instinct and whatever joint amount of experience we have.</p>
<p>Nontheless my vision to expand DosAuto was to develop a unified enterpise software for pool management that could bring a host of new business activities and organisational change to customers like single man pool cleaners, pool management companies themselves, pool equipment distributors and facility management companies</p>

<p>This repo will mainly showcase how I use cloud and other relevant technologies to build this software to deliever the below mentioned activities</p>
