<h1>From v1 to Enterprise grade application</h1>

<p>
  A few years ago I have built DosAuto, a sensor driven automated chlorination system that included a web application and an alert system to warn users about the state of their pool hygiene.  
  At that time, it can be seen as quite a feat to build something off a raspberry pi.  However when we installed and operated these systems at multiple clients, there were technical and functional challenges when we operate the solution at scale.
  After so long, I came around to think that DosAuto can be something bigger all along, something like a platform where automated pool disinfection is one of the activities or services that can be provided for the industry.
  Applications such as predictive maintenance, remote supervision, drowning detection, resource planning, CPQ can be included in this platform to enable pool cleaners, whether they are a one man operation, or an enterprise, so much more.
  Pool owners, be it a private pool owner, or a facility management company managing multiple properties with aquatic facilities, can also be accomodated.
