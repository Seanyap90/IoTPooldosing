# IoT for Swimming Pool Chemical Maintenance

## Hardware involved
- Any microprocessor such as a Raspberry pi
- pH and ORP probes from Atlas Scientific or any other brand as long as the probes are terminated by BNC.
- USB carrier boards from Atlas Scientific for the raspberry pi interface with the pH and ORP sensors
- Mechanical relays or solid state relays
- LED lights
- Dosing pumps (optional - dependent on swimming pool plant rooms)
- Routers and repeaters*

## Hardware System Setup
1. Sensor
Need both the probes and their corresponding reading chips:
